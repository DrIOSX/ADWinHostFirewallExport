SHORT DESCRIPTION
    A PowerShell module for retrieving, auditing, and exporting firewall rules and manageability data
    from Active Directory hosts.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    ADWindowsHostFirewallExport is a PowerShell module designed to query Active Directory
    for active servers and workstations, evaluate their manageability (via WS-Man), and
    retrieve detailed firewall rules and profile settings.

    The module includes:
    - **Get-ADHostManageability**: Identifies Active Directory computers and determines if they are remotely accessible.
    - **Get-ADHostFirewallStatus**: Retrieves firewall profile settings (Domain, Private, Public).
    - **Get-ADHostFirewallStatusReport**: Combines manageability data with firewall status.
    - **Get-ADHostFirewallRulesExport**: Collects and exports firewall rule details, including profiles, protocols, addresses, and programs.
    - **Resolve-FirewallResourceString**: Converts Windows firewall resource strings into human-readable names.

    The module dynamically loads and compiles a C# class (`ResourceStringResolver`) to resolve firewall resource names,
    eliminating the need to retrieve and parse external files.

    Firewall rule data includes:
    - Profile (Domain, Private, Public)
    - Rule action (Allow, Block)
    - Protocol, Port, Addresses
    - Associated Programs
    - Resolved Rule Group Names

    The module supports exporting data to CSV format, allowing administrators to audit firewall configurations
    and determine which systems are remotely manageable.

EXAMPLES
    PS C:\> Get-ADHostManageability -DaysInactive 30 -Servers -Verbose

    Retrieves Active Directory servers that have been active within the last 30 days,
    checks their manageability (via WS-Man), and returns the results.

    PS C:\> Get-ADHostFirewallStatusReport -ComputerName "Server01"

    Retrieves firewall status and manageability details for "Server01".

    PS C:\> Get-ADHostFirewallRulesExport -ComputerName "Server01"

    Retrieves and exports enabled inbound firewall rules from the remote server "Server01".

    PS C:\>
    # Generate timestamped filename in YYYY.MM.DD.HHMM format
    $timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyy.MM.dd.HHmm"
    $outputFilePath = "C:\temp\$timestamp.firewallRules.csv"

    # Ensure output directory exists
    $outputDir = Split-Path -Path $outputFilePath
    if (-not (Test-Path -Path $outputDir)) {
        New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $outputDir -Force | Out-Null
    }

    $results = Get-ADHostFirewallStatusReport -ComputerName (Get-ADHostManageability -DaysInactive 30 -Servers).ComputerName
    $remotableServers = $results | Where-Object { $_.IsRemotable }

    $firewallRules = Get-ADHostFirewallRulesExport -ComputerName $remotableServers.ComputerName -Verbose

    $firewallRules | Export-Csv -Path $outputFilePath -NoTypeInformation
    Start-Process $outputFilePath

    Exports firewall rules from all remotely manageable servers to a CSV file with a
    timestamped filename.

NOTE:
    Thank you to all contributors who helped refine this module by providing feedback, testing, and code contributions.

TROUBLESHOOTING NOTES:
    - If a host is unreachable, verify that WS-Management (WinRM) is enabled and firewall rules allow remote management.
    - If firewall resource strings do not resolve correctly, ensure that `ResourceStringResolver` is loaded in memory.
    - For debugging, use `Write-TimestampedMessage -Type Debug` to trace execution flow.
